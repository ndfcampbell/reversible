# Efficient, Accurate and Stable Gradients for Neural ODEs

## Overview
This repository contains a JAX implementation of the Reversible Solver method introduced in [link].

We present a general class of algebraically reversible solvers that allows any explicit numerical solver to be made reversible. This class of reversible solvers produce exact, memory-efficient gradients and are:
- high-order,
- numerically stable,
- and naturally extend to Neural CDEs and SDEs.
